  caveats <<~EOS
    First use: open TunnelMac and follow the setup guide. Pick the VPN types you
    use and install only those clients (brew install openfortivpn, openvpn,
    wireguard-go, openconnect and/or snx-rs; the guide shows the command),
    activate its service,
    approve it in System Settings and approve each client once.

    Updates: TunnelMac offers new versions and installs them itself
    (Atualizar agora). To use brew upgrade instead, quit TunnelMac with Sair
    first (this disconnects its VPNs). The service registration is kept for
    the upgraded app either way.

    Before brew uninstall: open the app, use Configurações… > Serviço
    privilegiado > Remover serviço, then quit with Sair. Homebrew's sandbox does
    not allow removing the registration.

    Migrating from OpenFortiDesk.app or VPNGUI.app (same product, earlier
    name): remove its service first the same way, quit it, then
    brew uninstall --cask openfortidesk (if installed) before installing.

    Stable release: see the release validation report for supported platforms.
    Profiles, Keychain secrets and the protected runtime survive uninstall. Do not
    reopen the app during an upgrade. See SECURITY.md before removing managed root
    files.
